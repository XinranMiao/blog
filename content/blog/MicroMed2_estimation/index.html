title: Mediation Analysis on the Microbiome Outcome

<p>This analysis is developed with Hanying Jiang and Prof. Kris Sankaran.</p>
<p>In order to interpret the treatment effect on microbial composition along mediation pathways, we generalize the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-021-01129-3">Logistic Normal Multinomia (LNM) model</a> into a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/a0020761">mediation framework</a>. We estimate natural direct and indirect effects on synthetic datasets and evaluate its power across experimental configurations.</p>

<h3>The Base Model: Logistic Normal Multinomial</h3>
<p>To associate microbiota profiles <span class="math inline">\(Y\in\mathbb{N}^{K}\)</span> with the treatment indicator <span class="math inline">\(T\in\{0,1\}\)</span>, the Logistic Normal Multinomial assumes that taxa counts are drawn from a multinomial distribution with probability parameter (<span class="math inline">\(\varphi^{-1}(\mu\)</span>)) that, after logit transformation (<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>), depends linearly on <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. The size parameter is set to the sample’s read depth, and pre-treatment covariates <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> can be can be added to the regression on <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> to control for their potential influence.</p>
<p>As the name suggests,  accounts for varying read depths,  incorporates covariates, and  bridges them together.
Like other regression models, the LNM can be adapted to encode problem-specific assumptions, like the presence of mediators, which makes the mediation generalization possible.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(y_{i_r}\in\mathbb{N}^{K}\)</span> be a length <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> vector denoting the counts for the <span class="math inline">\(r^{th}\)</span> replicate of the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> sample, across <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> genera among <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> samples (<span class="math inline">\(i=1,\cdots n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(r=1, 2, 3\)</span>). Then formula <a href="#eq:lnmeta">(1)</a> and <a href="#eq:lnmmu">(2)</a> describe the linear regression on treatment and covariates, and formula <a href="#eq:lnmy">(3)</a> and <a href="#eq:phiinv">(4)</a> link the regression terms with the microbiome counts. <span class="math inline">\(\eta_i\in\mathcal{R}^{K-1}\)</span> is the expected value of <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{i_r}\)</span> and represents sample <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>’s typical microbiota profile on a logit scale. <span class="math inline">\(\varphi^{-1}\)</span> transforms <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{i_r}\)</span> from the logit scale into a probability. We use <span class="math inline">\(N_{i_r}\)</span> to represent the total count of <span class="math inline">\(y_{i_r}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>’s and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_d^2\)</span> for unknown parameters.</p>

<h3>LNM + Mediation Framework</h3>
<p>The LNM implies a causal relationship: intervention leads to microbiota shifts. To illuminate the underlying mechanism, we assume the treatment effect to be modulated by some mediators (<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>). For example, the mindfulness training affects diet, which, as a mediator, affects the microbiome. In the causal graph with a mediation pathway, the treatment effect can be decomposed into two parts, the effect that works through mediators (indirect effect) and the effect that does not (direct effect).</p>
<p>Mathematically, we replace the linear regression equation <a href="#eq:lnmeta">(1)</a> with two formulas: equations <a href="#eq:medreg1">(5)</a> for mediator <span class="math inline">\(m_i\)</span> and <a href="#eq:medreg2">(6)</a> for the sample mean <span class="math inline">\(\eta_i\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>’s and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_d^2\)</span> are unknown parameters representing the treatment’s effect on mediators (for example, the influence of mindfulness training on diet).</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:medreg1">\[\begin{equation}
    m_i \sim \text{Normal} (\alpha_0 + \alpha_T t_i + \alpha_x^T x_i , \text{diag}(\sigma^2_d))
    \tag{5}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:medreg2">\[\begin{equation}
  \eta_i = \beta_0 + \beta_T t_i + \beta_M^T m_i + \beta_X^Tx_i
  \tag{6}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Formula <a href="#eq:medreg1">(5)</a> suggests that we can think of the mediator <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> as a function of the treatment indicator <span class="math inline">\(t&#39;\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(M\sim\text{Normal}(\alpha_0, \text{diag}(\sigma^2_k))\)</span> if we don’t intervene (<span class="math inline">\(t&#39;=0\)</span>), and <span class="math inline">\(M\sim\text{Normal}(\alpha_0 +\alpha_T t&#39;, \text{diag}(\sigma^2_k))\)</span> otherwise. We use <span class="math inline">\(M(t&#39;)\)</span> to represent such dependence. Similarly, we can write the outcome <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> as a function of both the mediator <span class="math inline">\(M(t&#39;)\)</span> and the treatment <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(Y(t, M(t&#39;))\)</span>. To avoid the effect of heterogeneous read depths, we convert counts <span class="math inline">\(Y(t, M(t&#39;))\)</span> into relative abundance <span class="math inline">\(R(t, M(t&#39;))\)</span>.</p>
<p>In our experiment, we can only observe the <span class="math inline">\(t=t&#39;\)</span> case: <span class="math inline">\(R(1, M(1))\)</span> for the treated group, and <span class="math inline">\(R(0, M(0))\)</span> for the control group. Their difference is the total treatment effect:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  \text{total\ difference}=  R(1, M(1)) - R(0, M(0)).
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>As long as our model is good enough, we can counterfactually generate <span class="math inline">\(R(1, M(0))\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R(0, M(1))\)</span> from the estimated model parameters, even though these quantities are not observed. Following the general mediation framework proposed by , we are able to quantify the indirect effect
<span class="math display" id="eq:indirect">\[\begin{equation}
    \delta = \dfrac{1}{2}\sum_{t=0}^1\{R(t, M(1)) - R(t, M(0)) \}
    \tag{7}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>that the treatment affects microbiota profiles through mediators,
and the direct effect
<span class="math display" id="eq:direct">\[\begin{equation}
    \tau =\dfrac{1}{2}\sum_{t&#39;=0}^1\{ R(1, M(t&#39;)) - R(0 , M(t&#39;))\}
     \tag{8}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>that the treatment works through other mechanisms. In the rest of this article, indirect effect and direct effect refer to the average of the estimated values of <a href="#eq:indirect">(7)</a> and <a href="#eq:direct">(8)</a> across samples, respectively.</p>

<h2>Simulation</h2>
<div id="semi-synthetic-data-generation" class="section level3">
<h3>Semi-synthetic data generation</h3>
<p>We start with a genus-level amplicon sequence variant (ASV) table, where each of the <span class="math inline">\(293\)</span> rows represent a sample, and each of the <span class="math inline">\(56\)</span> columns represent a genus. Entries are counts of how many times a genus appears in a sample. Samples are randomized with binary treatment. Since this dataset hasn’t been published, we demonstrate the estimation on semi-synthetic datasets.</p>
<p>Instead of simulating data from our LNM-Mediation assumptions, we generate synthetic data through a non-parametric procedure. This will result in an honest evaluation of the proposed LNM-Meidation model, since it is not well-suited to the synthetic dataset.</p>
<p>Specifically for each genus, we apply a two-part Zero-Inflated Quantile Regression (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-021-01129-3">ZINQ</a>) approach for each genus. After fitting ZINQ on the real data, we modify its coefficients to ensure that true effects of either type exist in 25% of the genera. We generate microbiome count datasets with rescaled coefficients and different sample sizes.</p>
</div>
<div id="estimation" class="section level3">
<h3>Estimation</h3>
<p>With proper priors, we estimate parameters in the proposed LNM-Mediation model via <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1506.03431">variational inference in Stan</a>, and obtain 90% credible intervals for both direct and indirect across <span class="math inline">\(56\)</span> genera.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-evaluation" class="section level3">
<h3>Model Evaluation</h3>
<p>We assess our model by the false sign rate and power defined below. The false sign rate reflects how many mistakes a model makes among the effects it discovers. For any discovered effect, we count it as a  if the true effect doesn’t exist or has the opposite direction. The false sign rate is analogous to the false discovery rate in the multiple testing literature and is more conservative (check <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxw041">this paper</a> for details).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
    \text{power}&amp;= \frac{\# \text{ of discoveries with a correct effect direction}}{\#\text{ of true existing effects }}\\
    \text{false sign rate} &amp;= 1-\frac{\# \text{ of discoveries with a correct effect direction}}{\# \text{ of discoveries}}
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>To study the relationship between the estimated effect size and the false sign rate, we only claim a model discovers an effect if its 90% credible interval deviates from zero by some threshold. Setting the threshold to 0 recovers the standard credible interval interpretation, and as the threshold increases from zero, the decision rule becomes conservative. We anticipate the false sign rate to drop along the way, since otherwise one would have to believe in a strong effect in the wrong direction. We evaluate the false sign rate for direct and indirect effects across a grid of thresholds. Further, given any target false sign rate, we estimate power using the number of correct discoveries at that threshold.</p>
<p>The Figure below demonstrates the power of LNM-Mediation across target False Sign Rate. The <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>- and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>- axes represent target false sign rate and number of discovered effects, respectively. Curves are colored by the signal strength: red means small signals and blue means large ones. Panels are faceted by effect types (row-wise) and sample sizes (column-wise).</p>
<p><img src="figures/power.png" width="694" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>At the most ideal setting, we can anticipate the LNM-Mediation to discover all direct effects with FSR smaller than 0.40, and all indirect effects with FSR smaller than 0.50. In the future, we will apply the proposed LNM-Mediation on real datasets and shed light on biological mechanisms.</p>
