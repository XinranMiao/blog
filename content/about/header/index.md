This website is created for MATH 888 (causal inference) course project in fall 2022.


Causal inference is an important area in statistics, but I've never taken any related courses yet. I'm more than excited that Prof. Amy Cochran is providing this course, and I can't wait to share my project with you! 


For causal inference, I'm interested in causal mediation analysis and sensitivity analysis.
